                If Male than value is 1, if not than value is 0.

              <li>
                <h5>Education:</h5>
                Less than HSC level (1), HSC level (2), graduation (3) and
                post-graduation (4).

              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Cigarettes Per Day:</h5>
                Number of cigarettes you consume in a day.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>BP Medicines:</h5>
                If you are currently on blood pressure medicines than enter 1
                otherwise 0.
              </li>

                <h5>BP Medicines:</h5>

              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Total Cholesterol:</h5>
                High levels of total cholesterol, particularly LDL cholesterol,
                can lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can
                increase the risk of CHD.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Systolic Blood Pressure:</h5>
                Elevated systolic blood pressure, the pressure in the arteries
                when the heart beats, is a major risk factor for CHD. Over time,
                high blood pressure can damage the arteries and increase the
                risk of heart disease.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Diastolic Blood Pressure:</h5>
                Although less strongly linked to CHD than systolic blood
                pressure, high diastolic blood pressure, the pressure in the
                arteries when the heart is at rest, can also contribute to an
                increased risk of heart disease.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>BMI:</h5>
                Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and
                weight.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Heart Rate:</h5>
                Resting heart rate is generally not considered a major risk
                factor for CHD, but higher heart rates during physical activity
                or exercise can indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular
                events. This may be due to increased strain on the heart or
                blood vessels, or because higher heart rates are often
                associated with other cardiovascular risk factors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Glucose:</h5>
                The level of glucose (sugar) in the blood.
              </li>
