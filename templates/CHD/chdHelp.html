            Coronary heart disease(CHD) is the term that describes what happens
            when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a
            build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries. Over time,
            the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits.
            This process is known as atherosclerosis and the fatty deposits are
            called atheroma. Atherosclerosis can be caused by lifestyle factors,
            such as smoking and regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.
            You're also more at risk of getting atherosclerosis if you have
            conditions like high cholesterol, high blood pressure (hypertension)
            or diabetes.
